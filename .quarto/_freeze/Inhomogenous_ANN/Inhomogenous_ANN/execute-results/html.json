We will also convert the mapping units from meters to kilometers using the `rescale` function.\n\nOur earlier PPM analysis suggested that the population density distribution (expressed on a log scale), could help explain the observed distribution of Walmart stores. We therefore need to account for this *inhomogeneity* in the underlying 1^st^ order effect before tackling a distance based analysis which addresses the 2^nd^ order effect of the underlying process. In other words, we want to make sure that any clustering or dispersion observed in our data is not a result of a varying population distribution.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Inhomogenous_ANN_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_d80a227c4606f16f1c0faeb3fe89e9e9'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load packages\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(maptools)\nlibrary(spatstat)\nlibrary(raster)\n\n# Read state polygon data\ns  <- st_read(\"MA.shp\")\nw  <- as.owin(s)\nw.km <- rescale(w, 1000)\n\n# Read Walmart point data\ns  <- st_read(\"Walmarts.shp\")\np  <- as.ppp(s)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in as.ppp.sf(s): only first attribute column is used for marks\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmarks(p) <- NULL\np.km <- rescale(p, 1000)\nWindow(p.km) <- w.km     \n\n# Read population raster\nimg     <- raster(\"./log_pop_sqmile.tif\") # load a raster layer file\nrast     <- as.im(img)  # Convert raster object to an im object\nrast.km  <- rescale(rast, 1000)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Average nearest neighbor analysis\n\nFirst, we'll compute the observed Walmart ANN statistic.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Inhomogenous_ANN_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_7bc1f73f18ffddeddec39f2d9b13b778'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nann.p <- mean(nndist(p.km, k=1))\nann.p\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 13.29478\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe observed average nearest neighbor is 13.29 km.\n\n### Is our observed ANN value consistent with a random process when controlled for population distribution (inhomogeneous process)?\n\nIn our earlier analysis of the point pattern, we calculated a (pseudo) p-value of around 0.33. The problem with our initial ANN analysis is that we did not account for [1^st^ order effects](https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/chp11-0.html#first-and-second-order-effects) of the underlying process such as population distribution (a possible covariate). In other words, is the distance observed between Walmart stores a reflection of the attractive/repulsive forces at play when positioning the stores within the state of Massachusetts or is their proximity to one another dictated by some underlying process such as population density distribution?\n\nIf we are to assume that population distribution will influence the distribution of Walmart stores, we need to rerun the ANN analysis while **controlling** for population distribution influence. We do this by instructing the `rpoint()` function to increase point placement probability at locations with high covariate values (i.e. a high population density area is more likely to receive a random point than a low density area).\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Inhomogenous_ANN_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_3cf3055e0697f99bd08dd99c52e51054'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn     <- 1999\nann.het <- vector()\nfor (i in 1:n){\n  rand.p   <- rpoint(n = p.km$n, f = rast.km) \n  ann.het[i] <- mean(nndist(rand.p, k = 1))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe above loop is almost identical to that of the homogeneous case except with the addition of the `f = rast.km` argument which defines the intensity of the underlying process (`rast.km` represents the population density raster). The `rpoint` function rescales the raster values to a range of `[0,1]` where `1` designates maximum probability of a pixel receiving a point and `0` minimum (or no) probability of a pixel receiving a point. It's therefore important to remember that you want the large pixel values to be associated with a greater probability of receiving a point. If you want to reverse the relationship, in other words if you want to assign a greater probability of placing a point where you have a small pixel value, simply inverse the pixel values by computing 1 / (pixel value) (this can be done in the GIS software or in R via `rast.km[] = 1 / rast.km[]`. Note that the covariate raster cannot have negative values.\n\nThe following map shows an example of how the Walmart store distribution *could* look like *if* dictated by population distribution.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Inhomogenous_ANN_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_e4419fe2b1a8e20e67565003e296bc3d'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(rand.p, pch = 16, main = NULL)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Inhomogenous_ANN_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt may not look terribly different from the homogeneous ANN model, but if you were to tally all point distributions from each simulation, you would very likely find more points occurring in areas with higher population values (as expressed by the raster layer).\n\nNow, let's plot the histogram of simulated ANN values:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Inhomogenous_ANN_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_91a83423c47dab43e5ef6a637d12ae78'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(ann.het, breaks = 40, col = \"bisque\", xlim = range(ann.p, ann.het), main = NULL)\nabline(v = ann.p, col = \"blue\", lw = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Inhomogenous_ANN_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe histogram is displaying the range of expected ANN values when the placement of Walmart points are dictated by the population distribution.\n\nOur observed ANN value lies to the right of the distribution center suggesting that our observed Walmart may be more *dispersed* than expected under the current hypothesis. This makes sense since you would expect there to be a minimum distance between stores to avoid overlapping markets.\n\nThe p-value is thus:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Inhomogenous_ANN_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-6_0cffc04eb1b8d1b5a4f2b2ca791643df'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nN.greater <- sum(ann.het > ann.p)\np <- min(N.greater + 1, n + 1 - N.greater) / (n +1)\np\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.1435\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that this is a smaller p-value than that computed under the homogeneous scenario. \n\n## Final note\n\nWhile the histogram may imply that it's the *observed* ANN value that has shifted rightward along the x-axis relative to the hypothesized distribution, it's really the *distribution* that gets shifted along the x-axis. The following plot overlays the expected ANN distribution given a homogeneous 1^st^ order process in red and the expected ANN distribution given the inhomogeneous 1^st^ order process in green. The observed ANN value of 13.3 km is constant under both analyses!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='Inhomogenous_ANN_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-7_e94591f6d48687b370334546dcbd9be8'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in hist.default(ann.hom, breaks = 40, col = \"bisque\", main = NULL, :\narguments 'col', 'main' are not made use of\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in hist.default(ann.het, breaks = 40, col = \"green\", main = NULL, :\narguments 'col', 'main' are not made use of\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Inhomogenous_ANN_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n",
